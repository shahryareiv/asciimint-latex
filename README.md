# Asciimint-latex

The latex part of the asciimint. Still a very personal code complex but one might look up things in the code. Generally, the new macros and environment have `\myxxxx` `\begin{myxxxx}` or `\amXxXx`x and  `\begin{amXxXxx}` naming convetion.

A docment should be like `asciimint_article.tex` or `asciimint_book.tex`, calling the `asciimint` package. `asciimint_graphics.sty` is called automatically by  `asciimint`; it has got separated for pure graphic tex files that do not need the rest of the package.

The whole package is based on `tufte-latex` https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex
